## 7️⃣ Detection & Validation Logic

### 7.1 Topic Validation

Before invoking the AI model, the system validates whether the user query is **cyber security related**.

#### Allowed Topic Keywords (Examples)

* phishing
* malware
* password
* vpn
* firewall
* cyber security
* online safety
* privacy

If no valid topic is detected, the query is **rejected**.

---

### 7.2 Safety Guardrails

The system blocks or safely redirects requests containing:

* “hack”
* “bypass”
* “exploit”
* “crack”
* “steal”

---

## 8️⃣ AI Control Mechanism

### 8.1 AI Model

* OpenAI Chat Model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini)

### 8.2 System Prompt (Behavior Lock)

The AI is configured with a **strict system instruction** to:

* Respond only to cyber security topics
* Provide educational, defensive explanations
* Refuse non-security or harmful requests

This ensures **policy compliance and ethical AI usage**.

---

## 9️⃣ Response Policy

### Allowed Responses

* Definitions
* Awareness guidance
* Best practices
* High-level explanations

### Restricted Responses

* Step-by-step attacks
* Tool recommendations for hacking
* Code or exploit details

---

## 10️⃣ Rejection & Fallback Handling

### Unrelated Question Response

```
I can only assist with cyber security related topics such as phishing, malware, password safety, and online security.
```

### Unsafe Request Response

```
I can provide cyber security education and awareness, but I can’t assist with hacking or illegal activities.
```

---

## 11️⃣ Logging & Monitoring (Optional)

### Logged Data (If Enabled)

* Timestamp
* Question category
* Accepted / Rejected status

### Purpose

* Measure awareness trends
* Improve keyword coverage
* SOC reporting

⚠️ No personal or sensitive data is stored.

---

## 12️⃣ Compliance & Ethics

* Defensive and educational use only
* No interception of private communications
* No personal data processing
* Aligns with responsible AI principles

---

## 13️⃣ Limitations

* Keyword-based topic validation may miss edge cases
* AI responses depend on prompt quality
* No real-time threat detection

---

## 14️⃣ Future Enhancements (SOC Roadmap)

| Enhancement            | Benefit            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| MITRE ATT&CK mapping   | Industry alignment |
| Quiz & assessment mode | Security training  |
| Confidence scoring     | Answer reliability |
| Multi-language support | Wider awareness    |
